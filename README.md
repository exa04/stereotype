# stereotype
Stereotype is an audio plugin for simple stereo manipulation, written using the JUCE framework. Stereotype is functionally very similar to Image-Line's Fruity Stereo Shaper. It allows for rerouting of the right and left audio channels, as well as phase inversion and stereo offset, the resulting left and right channel data can also be recombined. This can be useful for a static phaser type effect.
## Installing
To use it in your DAW, download the VST3 file from the releases section. Then, drag it intoyour VST3 folder. Most likely, you'll find it under `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`. Your DAW probably lists it, too.
