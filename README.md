# stereotype
Stereotype is an audio plugin for simple stereo manipulation, written using the JUCE framework. Stereotype is functionally very similar to Image-Line's Fruity Stereo Shaper. It allows for rerouting of the right and left audio channels, as well as phase inversion and stereo offset, the resulting left and right channel data can also be recombined. This can be useful for a static phaser type effect.
